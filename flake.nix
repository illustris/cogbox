				#
				# The GUEST is never told about any of this. It sees two ordinary
				# virtio-blk devices and mounts them BY LABEL: nothing in the guest

				# node management where it does not -- so neither is less stable than
				# the other, and /dev/mapper/ mangles a dash in the VG name into a
				# double dash (cogworx--guest-pool), an error-prone literal to keep in

				# because this mount is neededForBoot and no in-guest unit could repair
				# it. And it is how this volume GROWS: `x-systemd.growfs` cannot run for
				# an initrd mount (systemd-growfs@.service is a stage-2 upstream unit

				# no /root mount, harness overlays still present.
				# `before` on an entry is NOT decoration, and the journal bind is the
				# reason the field exists rather than the only user of it. Every bind

				# `legacy` is the path ON THE 9P SHARE that the pool copy replaces, and it is

				# layout (a rolled-back image, or an accepted degraded boot) presented a
				# stale-but-complete-looking tree as if it were current, the user worked in
				# it, and the next healthy boot hid that session again with nothing but an

			#     mount a FRESH pod-owned cgroup2 instead (a confined SYS_ADMIN may

			#     the single CAP_SYS_ADMIN the pod is granted for exactly this — no
			#     privileged, no /dev/kvm, no NET_ADMIN/RAW. systemd in container
			#     mode does NOT self-remount a ro cgroup (verified), so this is required.
			#  2. Writable /etc. dockerTools lays the NixOS toplevel's own /etc as
			#     a symlink into the immutable Nix store, so activation's setup-etc
			#     cannot populate it. Drop the symlink; NixOS then builds a fresh

			# POOL-ABSENT DEGRADATION, proved with the real generator rather than
			# argued. This is the property S3/R4 and the README rest on -- "a pool that
			# fails to appear degrades the guest to the pre-pool layout" -- and it is
			# NOT implied by `nofail` on the pool mount alone. Concrete triggers: a
			# legacy instance whose third disk was never attached, a failed
			# create/attach leg, or a disk the host-side format never labelled, so
			# /dev/disk/by-label/... times out.
			#
			# Two mechanisms can each turn that into emergency.target, and neither is
			# visible by reading the fstab:
			#
			#   1. systemd-fstab-generator emits a non-`nofail` entry into
			#      local-fs.target.REQUIRES; local-fs.target ships
			#      OnFailure=emergency.target with
			#      OnFailureJobMode=replace-irreversibly, so one failed bind replaces
			#      the whole queued multi-user.target transaction -> no sshd.
			#   2. harness-setup-dirs Requires= the harness-rw mount. If that fails the
			#      four overlay UPPERDIRS are never created and the four overlay mounts
			#      fail too. That cascade runs through a SERVICE, so no amount of nofail
			#      on the binds reaches it.
			#   3. systemd MANUFACTURES a hard Requires= on the mount unit covering a
			#      mount's parent directory (src/core/mount.c:270-281), the one covering
			#      an absolute bind or loop SOURCE (:284-294), and the one covering every
			#      path prefix named in RequiresMountsFor= (src/core/unit.c:1522-1542:
			#      UNIT_MOUNT_REQUIRES becomes UNIT_REQUIRES for any covering unit that
			#      has a fragment path, which fstab-generated units always have). In
			#      hosted that reaches SIX mounts whose own fstab lines name no pool path
			#      at all: the four harness overlays, through the upper/work dirs nixpkgs
			#      renders as RequiresMountsFor=, and the two opencode ephemeral binds,
			#      through both their parent and their source. A first version of this
			#      check enumerated only lines whose SOURCE was on the pool, so it passed
			#      while all six sat in local-fs.target.requires -- VACUOUS with respect
			#      to the one property it exists to prove. Hence the three rules are
			#      re-implemented below instead of the affected mounts being listed.
			#

			# mkPoolBind moves all seven binds from .wants to .requires, and dropping

				# So every REALIZED service unit of the hosted guest is scanned against

				#   the pool-prep units       cogbox-guest-dirs and the two migrations
				#                             exist only to prepare the pool. Requiring it

			# The carve script, RUN rather than read. The eval check above can only

			# passes on a script whose control flow is wrong -- an inverted test, an
			# `exit 0` moved below the mkfs, a blkid guard that reads "could not read
			# the disk" as "blank", or a grow leg that sizes the pool before the store
			# would all satisfy them while destroying the user's work tree or silently
			# never growing. This is the one piece of code in the change that can
			# destroy data that has no other copy, so its contract is exercised against
			# real block devices, a real volume group and a real mkfs.
			#
			# The fixture is a SYMLINK at the script's baked by-id path, which is
			# exactly what udev creates on the real host -- so the script runs
			# unmodified and un-parameterised, addressing the device, the volume group
			# and the two logical volumes by the names it ships with. `[ -b ]` follows
			# symlinks, so pointing it at a loop device, a regular file, a
			# device-mapper error target or nothing at all selects the branches.
			#
			# The one thing that IS parameterised is the store overlay's size: the
			# shipped 16 GiB would mean a multi-gigabyte tmpfs and a minutes-long mkfs
			# in a vmTools VM for a property that has nothing to do with the number.
			# gce-image-guest-disk-format asserts the shipped size AND diffs the two
			# realized scripts with the size lines normalised out, so this cannot drift
			# into testing different code.
			#
			# DM_DISABLE_UDEV is set for the FIXTURE, never in the shipped script:
			# there is no udevd in this VM, so lvm has to create the device nodes
			# itself instead of waiting on a udev cookie that will never be answered.
			#
			# THE BLIND SPOT THAT SETTING CREATES, named here because three rounds of
			# review derived a false premise from a fixture that cannot express the
			# question. On the SHIPPED image this script is NOT the only thing that
			# activates the volume group. `services.lvm.enable` is true, which puts
			# lvm2 in `services.udev.packages` (MEASURED on the realized host), and
			# /etc/lvm/lvm.conf leaves `event_activation` at its default 1 -- so
			# lvm2's own 69-dm-lvm.rules fires off the disk's uevent and runs
			# `systemd-run --no-block ... lvm vgchange -aay cogworx-guest`,
			# INDEPENDENTLY of this unit and before it (which keeps
			# DefaultDependencies and so starts after basic.target) has run a line.
			# Both /dev/cogworx-guest/{pool,store} therefore exist on boots where
			# this script exited early -- and supervise.sh leg (e2), which tests only
			# that those two nodes are block devices, launches a guest on them.
			#
			# THIS FIXTURE CANNOT REPRODUCE THAT ACTIVATOR, and the reason is
			# structural rather than a missing line: the rule's RUN+= is
			# `/run/current-system/systemd/bin/systemd-run --no-block`, which needs a
			# systemd MANAGER on D-Bus. vmTools' stage 2 is a shell script as PID 1,
			# with no systemd and no dbus, so running udevd with lvm2's rules here
			# would fire a rule whose activation command cannot work. Case 14 below
			# therefore SIMULATES the state instead: it activates the volume group
			# from the fixture before invoking the script, exactly as udev would have,
			# and then makes the script exit early. What that reproduces is
			# "both nodes exist without this unit having created them in this host
			# boot", which is the premise every store-mkfs guard rests on. What it
			# does NOT reproduce is udev's activation racing this unit in TIME; only
			# a real GCE boot can show that, so the image pipeline's fresh-instance
			# validation is where that half is evidenced.

			# resolver to the guest, which answers internal names publicly or not
			# at all.
			#
			# THE MECHANISM, and why every leg below is load-bearing. passt is told
			# to INTERCEPT the guest's queries (`--dns-forward`) and re-emit them
			# to a loopback forwarder on the host (`--dns-host`), which is

			# /etc/resolv.conf is a LOOPBACK one (conf.c add_dns_resolv4). So:
			# resolved must be enabled, resolv.conf must point at its stub,
			# resolved's upstream must be the one `vpcResolver` names, and the units
			# that depend on it must be ordered after it. Miss any one and the guest is
